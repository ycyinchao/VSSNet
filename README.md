## Camouflaged Object Detection via Complementary Information-Selected Network based on Visual and Semantic Separation

The more qualitative results of VSSNet on four benchmarks (COD10K, NC4K, CAMO, CHAMELEON) have already been stored in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RV12SAH93VbAvrOw7zghJUgMrrklihj8/view?usp=sharing), please unzip it into the fold './results/'. <br>

The pretrained model is stored in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rKmp0Zu1ZL6Z9VsYfYAKRkG271AvZB6G/view?usp=sharing). After downloading, please put it in the './pretrained/' fold.

Our well-trained model is stored in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_iqEtc5VvhYSk5PSdyuFDsMdb7GlwdJo/view?usp=sharing), which should be moved into the fold './checkpoints/VSSNet_384/'.
